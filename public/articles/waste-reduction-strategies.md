# Zero Waste Living: Practical Strategies

Zero waste living is about minimizing the amount of waste we send to landfills through conscious consumption choices.

## The 5 R's

- Refuse what you don't need
- Reduce what you do need
- Reuse what you consume
- Recycle what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse
- Rot (compost) the rest

## Starting Small

Begin with simple swaps like reusable bags, water bottles, and food containers.

Zero waste living is a journey, not a destinationâ€”every small step contributes to a more sustainable future.
