## Getting Started

Even the smallest balcony or windowsill can become a productive growing space with the right approach.

## Best Plants for Urban Gardens

- Herbs like basil, mint, and parsley
- Leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach
- Compact vegetables like cherry tomatoes

Urban gardening not only provides fresh food but also improves air quality and mental well-being.
